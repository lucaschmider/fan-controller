# FanSpeedRelation

This project aims to see how the duty cycle of the pwm signal that is applied to the fan affects its speed.
There are 

## Questions
1. Is there a relationship between the duty cycle and the fan speed?
2. Can we synthesize a table or mathematic function that maps a fan speed to the required duty cycle?
3. Is this table or function specific to the minimum and maximum speed of the fan?
4. Is this table or function specific to the type of fan?
