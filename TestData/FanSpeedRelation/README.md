# FanSpeedRelation

This project aims to see how the duty cycle of the pwm signal that is applied to the fan affects its speed.
There are 

## Questions
1. Is there a linear relationship between the duty cycle and the fan speed?
2. Can we synthesize a table that maps a fan speed to the required duty cycle?
3. Is this table specific to the minimum and maximum speed of the fan?
4. Is this table specific to the type of fan?
